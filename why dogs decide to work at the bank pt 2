    <h1>Dogs become valuable employees at major bank</h1>
    <p>It was revealed this morning that a major high street bank has <strong>begun employing clever canines</strong> to perform basic data-entry tasks in several of its UK data centres. In a statement earlier today a spokesperson for the bank said that training had gone well with the <strong>first intake of ten pooches</strong> and that overall they were just happy to be involved.</p>

      <p>"I've made new friends, we have a great canteen, and in a few months I'll have earned enough for a deposit on my own kennel"</p>
