       <!-- ***
            This is all great so far. At this point though you run into a problem. You've not uploaded the media along with
            the html file. This first img element for example is telling the browser to look in a folder called img, but
            there is no folder called img in your GitHub repo.

            Additionally, folders don't have file extensions. There should be no .html after the folder names.
            *** -->

  <!-- ***
       The URLs you've provided for these source elements are problematic. They're full URLs on your system, not 
       relative urls within your website folder structure. 

       For example, the first one shoudl be something like:
       <source src="audio/audio1.wav" type="audio/wav" />

      You've also not included a fallback for browsers that don't support the audio element, or included a closing </audio> tag.
